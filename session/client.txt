Because working out client logic was confusing. This helped a bit.

* Autostart/kill condition (when to spawn or kill the client -- client can be dead when setting is true, but CANNOT be alive when setting is false):
	disabled (default)
		- Spawns (delayed) on command
		- Killed on command
		- Kept alive if already existed
	[dconf setting]
		- Spawns (delayed) when setting is valid
		- Killed when setting invalid
		- Spawns (delayed) on command only if setting valid
		- Killed on command
		- Kept alive only if setting valid
	TODO Support for other conditions (ex. while another process/client is alive?)
	
* Autorestart condition (when to restart the client on exit -- response to natural death of client):
	never
		- The client does not respawn, unless autostart/kill condition is changed
	fail-only
		- The client is respawned only if it exited with a fail status
	always
		- The client is always respawned, and will be kept alive until the condition is changed

* States:
	dead
		- Client has never spawned or is currently not spawned
	alive
		- Client is alive
	registered (alive)
		- Client is alive and registered
