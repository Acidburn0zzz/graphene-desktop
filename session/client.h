 *        will temporarily become not Ready until it registers or
 *        successfully exits again.
 *
 * Failed: Indicates that the client has unsuccessfully exit, and is not
 *        being restarted to attempt again. A client may change from Ready
 *        to Failed, but cannot be both. A Failed client cannot be Alive.
 *        If the client is not Complete, it may be started again when its
 *        auto-start condition is triggered (unsetting Failed).
 *
 * Complete: The client has exited, and will not, on its own, ever be alive
 *        again. This requires that its auto-start condition will never again
 *        be triggered. Once a client is Complete, it is no longer Alive and
 *        should probably be removed from any client lists. A client can only
 *        leave the Complete state if it is manually started through
 *        graphene_session_client_spawn or if its condition is changed.
 *        Clients retain their Ready or Failed state when they become Complete.
 *
 * A client may not meet any of these conditions for a small amount of time
 * while it (re)starts. A new client object is Complete by default.
