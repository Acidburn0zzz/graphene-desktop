Installing for Arch
--------

If you are running Arch Linux, you can install Graphene Desktop by adding
*cdn.velt.io/vosrepo/$arch* to your list of repositories and installing the
package *graphene-desktop* via pacman. [Click here for more detail.](https://velt.io/veltos-installation/)

Building Manually
--------

graphene-desktop uses the following libraries and packages:

    - cmake *(build only)*
    - accountsservice
    - gnome-control-center *(optional)*
    - gnome-menus
    - libpulse
	- librsvg
    - mutter >= 3.22
    - nautilus *(optional)*
    - paper-gtk-theme-git >= 297 *(optional)*
    - paper-icon-theme-git >= 552 *(optional)*
	- wicd

All of these are available from Arch's official repositories, the AUR,
or the vos repository. For any other Linux distros, you're on your own.

Download/clone this repo and

```bash

    cd graphene-desktop
    cmake .
    sudo make all install
```

To run, start Graphene from a login manager such as LightDM, or execute
'graphene-desktop' from an X terminal. Graphene can also run on Wayland
by executing 'graphene-desktop --wayland' from a non-X terminal.

Uninstall by running 'sudo make uninstall' in the graphene-desktop directory.
This only works when install\_manifest.txt, a file created after installing, is
available.
